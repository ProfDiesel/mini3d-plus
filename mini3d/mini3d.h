// Generally, you'd only need one of these, as they're two ways of solving the same problem:

// The Z buffer is slower but more accurate, and can handle intersecting geometry.
#define ENABLE_Z_BUFFER 1

// The ordering table is faster but can produce glitches if the table is too small or there's
// intersecting geometry in the scene.
#define ENABLE_ORDERING_TABLE 0

// allow textured faces
#define ENABLE_TEXTURES 1

// allow textures to have non-opaque pixels
#define ENABLE_TEXTURES_MASK 1

// allow textures to have lighting (optional) and intermediate colours (optional)
// all will be dithered on final render.
#define ENABLE_TEXTURES_GREYSCALE 1

// ignored if textures are disabled
// if 1, textures are mapped with homogenous coordinates.
// if 0, textures will be significantly warped as they approach
// the camera.
#define ENABLE_TEXTURES_PROJECTIVE 1

// only applies if if ENABLE_TEXTURES_PROJECTIVE.
// Only faces whose total z ratio (from closest to furthest point)
// is less than this will have projective textures.
// Comment this definition out entirely to use projective texture mapping
// indiscriminately.
#define TEXTURE_PROJECTIVE_RATIO_THRESHOLD 0.76

// clip faces which are partly behind the camera.
// This allows rendering faces which are partly behind the camera.
#define FACE_CLIPPING 1

// clip faces that are closer than this
#define CLIP_EPSILON 1.3f
